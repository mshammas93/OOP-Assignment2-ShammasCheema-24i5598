Assignment 2 for OOP class 

Question1a: 
Purpose: reverse (swap inward) the characters between two inclusive 1-based indices b1 and b2 in a null-terminated char array.
Preconditions: Array must be non-null and null-terminated; b1 and b2 are 1-based positions (1..length).
Steps inside ChangeLocation:
Return immediately if Array is null or if b1 >= b2 (base case).
Compute the string length to validate bounds.
If b1 < 1 or b2 > length, return (invalid bounds).
Swap Array[b1-1] and Array[b2-1].
Recurse with ChangeLocation(Array, b1+1, b2-1) to continue swapping the next inner pair.
Complexity: each recursion does a length scan O(L) plus a constant swap; overall worst-case O(k * L) where k â‰ˆ (b2-b1)/2. Passing length or using pointer arithmetic would reduce to O(L).
Example: "COMPUTER", b1=3, b2=7
Swap positions 3 and 7: C O E P U T M R
Next recursion swaps 4 and 6: positions already correct for this example; recursion stops when b1 >= b2.
main() demonstrates by printing the array before and after calling ChangeLocation(arr, 3, 7).

Question1b:
The program takes an integer input n and prints a specific numeric pattern using recursion.
When the program starts, it asks the user to enter a number. The function PrintPattern is then called, which prints one line at a time based on the current line number. The same function calls itself repeatedly until all lines are printed.
For the first line, it simply prints the number n.
For the second line, it divides n into two equal parts and prints them side by side.
From the third line onward, it prints several 1s followed by a number that decreases as the lines progress.
The recursion continues until the line number becomes greater than n, at which point the function stops calling itself.
This approach avoids loops in the main logic and relies on recursive calls to move from one line to the next. The base case ensures the recursion ends properly.
In short, the function prints the desired pattern step by step using recursion without using arrays or additional helper functions.

Question2:
The program is designed to represent and manage different geographical features such as land and water using object-oriented programming and a singly linked list.
The base class Feature defines a general template for all types of features and includes a pure virtual function called analyze, which makes it an abstract class. Two derived classes, LandFeature and WaterFeature, inherit from Feature and each implement their own version of the analyze function. The LandFeature class prints a message indicating that land has been detected, while the WaterFeature class prints a message indicating that a water body has been detected.
The SinglyLinkedList class manages a list of these features. Each element in the list, called a node, stores a feature ID, a pointer to a Feature object, and a pointer to the next node. The class provides several functions: inserting a new feature at the end, deleting a feature using its ID, displaying all the features, and reversing the list order. The destructor ensures that all dynamically allocated memory is properly released when the program ends.
In the main function, a linked list is created and four features are added: a forest, a river, a mountain, and a lake. The list is first displayed in its original order. Then the program deletes the feature with ID 102, which is the river, and shows the updated list. Finally, the list is reversed and displayed again.
This program demonstrates key programming concepts such as abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and dynamic memory management, along with practical linked list operations like insertion, deletion, traversal, and reversal.

Question3:
