Assignment 2 for OOP class 

Question1a: 
Purpose: reverse (swap inward) the characters between two inclusive 1-based indices b1 and b2 in a null-terminated char array.
Preconditions: Array must be non-null and null-terminated; b1 and b2 are 1-based positions (1..length).
Steps inside ChangeLocation:
Return immediately if Array is null or if b1 >= b2 (base case).
Compute the string length to validate bounds.
If b1 < 1 or b2 > length, return (invalid bounds).
Swap Array[b1-1] and Array[b2-1].
Recurse with ChangeLocation(Array, b1+1, b2-1) to continue swapping the next inner pair.
Complexity: each recursion does a length scan O(L) plus a constant swap; overall worst-case O(k * L) where k â‰ˆ (b2-b1)/2. Passing length or using pointer arithmetic would reduce to O(L).
Example: "COMPUTER", b1=3, b2=7
Swap positions 3 and 7: C O E P U T M R
Next recursion swaps 4 and 6: positions already correct for this example; recursion stops when b1 >= b2.
main() demonstrates by printing the array before and after calling ChangeLocation(arr, 3, 7).
